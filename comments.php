   <?php 
   // This is a one line comment
   /*This is a multiline comment 
   You can see even if i continue the comment on a second line it stil works as opposed to the traditional comment which uses the symbol (//) 
   to close this you need to do the same symbols that started your multiline comment 
   Wow computing is do fascinating! And now I will End My Comment
   By inputing the same symmbols you use d to start this cmment 
   But the key thing is to reverse the symbol or else you will get a syntax error 
   oh my god computing has so many rules 
   wow i cant believe how im typing this fast
   i dont even know if there is a typo in this text 
   Wow my typing is fast 
   Now to End Future ME should remember that when opening a multiline comment always use the symbol (/*) and when closing a multiline comment use this sign */ 
    //Always reverse the opening multiline comment opening symbol<span class="highlight"> just a line of code to remember for the future
   // This function below displays Text 
  
   echo "Wassup"
